Child
Why did you call for me?
Tree
Did you go outside of the Grove?
Child
...
Tree
I know you did, against what I told you so many times.
Child
I was just curious about what was outside...
Tree
And you found others like me, did you not?
Child
I did... but they were not like you. They got angry as soon as they saw me.
Tree
Of course they did. You are a human.
Tree
Humans are wonderful creatures, capable of so much good... and so much evil.
Child
I am not like those! I am like a tree!
Tree
You are a human...and now you were found. You must leave the Grove, Child.
Child
WHAT?!?! But the Grove is my home!
Tree
I am sorry, dear, but you must go. You're not safe here anymore, and I will not see you harmed.
Child
But the Grove is all I know! I will be good. I promise to never go out exploring again! *sob*
Tree
Child, it is my fault. I should have been more strict, taken better care of you...
Child
*sob* *sob*
Tree
It is your nature as human to wonder and explore, I knew this would happen, but it feels too early.
Child
Early?
Tree
...
Tree
You must go and find your people, the Trees will never accept you here. I am sorry, it is time to go.
Tree
Take my seeds, they will aid you along your journey. Remember, this is not a punishment...
Child
I dont want to gooooo!!!
Tree
...This is the destiny that I never wished for you...
Tree
Good bye now, my Child!
